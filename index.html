        <article class="portfolio-card" data-full-description="<p>A YC S23 startup built the world's first autonomous surgical robot. I designed C1 — the first version of the tablet interface that surgeons use to control the robot during prostate surgery.</p><p>The interface serves two roles simultaneously: it's a controller for manipulating the robot's movement and a live monitor showing the camera feed inside the patient. The surgeon needs both at all times.</p><p>A HoLEP procedure has four distinct surgical phases, and the interface needed to transition between them clearly while keeping the surgeon oriented. On top of that, the system had to surface error states — particularly proximity warnings when the robot approached sensitive tissue — in a way that was immediate but not disruptive during an active procedure.</p><p>The design decision I'm most proud of is the placement of the movement controller. I positioned it at the bottom of the screen, directly in the thumb zone, so it maps naturally to how a surgeon actually holds and rests their hands on an iPad. This sounds simple, but in a context where someone is controlling a robot inside a human body, the difference between a natural grip and an awkward reach matters.</p><p>To understand the surgical workflow, I studied HoLEP procedures on video, mapping each phase to understand what information the surgeon needs and when they need it.</p><p>This interface was used in the historic first robotic-assisted HoLEP procedure.</p>">

        <article class="portfolio-card" data-full-description="<p>Structured, insightful conversation has always been gatekept. You either get on a podcast, go on TV, or you don't have access to a skilled host who can guide a real discussion. Agora was built to change that — to give everyone access to a great moderator.</p><p>Agora is a live debate platform powered by an AI voice host. The host moderates real-time conversations between participants: it guides the structure of the debate, asks questions and follow-ups, fact-checks claims on the fly, and enforces the rules — all through voice, in real time.</p><p>The hardest problem was latency. A debate is a fast, emotionally charged interaction. If the AI host takes even a beat too long to interject, the moment is gone and the conversation derails. Getting the response time low enough for the host to feel like a natural presence in the room — not a delayed observer — was the central technical challenge.</p><p>I designed and built this end-to-end: Flutter on the frontend, Python and AWS on the backend, with LiveKit and an agentic AI architecture handling the real-time voice interaction layer.</p><p>Tested with an initial group of 10 users to validate the core experience.</p>">

        <article class="portfolio-card" data-full-description="<p>A startup set out to help people find the optimal wellness products for their needs through personal tracking and data-driven recommendations. I joined when the product was just an MVP and designed everything from there — as the only designer across the entire platform.</p><p>The consumer app lets users track their personal experiences over time. As the data builds, the app learns what works for them and helps them find and purchase the right products. The B2B retail platform connects to the other side — giving in-store staff a recommendation engine so they can guide customers to the best fit based on real user data.</p><p>The biggest challenge was retention. Tracking is a commitment — users need to see value fast or they stop logging. I designed the experience to surface meaningful insights early and keep the feedback loop between tracking, learning, and discovering products tight enough that users stayed engaged.</p><p>I was also the sole designer responsible for the entire ecosystem — consumer app, retail platform, and everything connecting them. We moved fast, took risks, and were first to market with this approach.</p><p>The consumer app scaled to 500k+ users, the retail platform deployed to 100+ stores, and the product helped support a $10M Series A raise.</p>">

        <article class="portfolio-card" data-full-description="<p>I designed and built this product end-to-end in Flutter — from concept through launch.</p><p>The idea is simple: screen time shouldn't be something you take away. It should be something kids earn. A parent creates quests — essentially a to-do list of tasks or goals. As the child completes them and the parent approves, they earn coins. Those coins can then be spent to purchase screen time.</p><p>It turns a restrictive, often frustrating dynamic between parents and kids into a system where the child has agency and the parent has control — without it feeling like punishment.</p><p>The hardest design challenge was onboarding. iOS imposes significant restrictions around accessing and controlling screen time permissions. The technical barrier to getting a user fully set up is high, which means the onboarding experience has to be exceptionally clear and motivating — if a parent hits friction during setup, they're gone. I focused on making each permission step feel purposeful and easy to understand rather than letting it become a wall of system prompts.</p>">
